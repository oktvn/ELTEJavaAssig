Note to Mr. Teacher :)

Slight deviation from initial specification:

If a golden ticket's serial number corresponds to the chocolate bar's serial number then that chocolate bar contains a golden ticket.
The `listWinners()` function is based upon this idea.
Please mind this when (and if) you're case-testing my solution.
Thank you.
